# Google Summer of Code 2020 Proposal

## Project Title
Cancer Region of Interest Extraction and Machine Learning

## Abstract / Project Summary
The proposed project aims to build a system to extract <b>Region of Interest (RoI)</b> from images based on user-selected class groups. Currently, the pipeline supports for a single-stage CNN network which only outputs the results (classes) when given an input image, which makes it difficult to use these results in other models. The proposal is to adapt the CNN to fetch <b>patches of regions</b> from the image that belong to a particular class and send back the positive class patches through the pipeline making it easy for other models to work on top of the results.
